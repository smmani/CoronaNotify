Git url : https://github.com/smmani/CoronaNotify.git

Branch : master

Simulation :

I have added a file “SimulatedLocations.gpx” to simulate the geofence. I have added three location coordinates in that file(“Phoenix Marketcity","Forum Vijaya Mall","Mayajaal Multiplex”) 


If you want change the coordinates manually, locate the file “RegionMonitor” and the method name “startLocationMonitoring” there, you can modify the lat-long array.
